# Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Proxy Voting Standard

### Abstract

This proposal uses plutus minting policies to create valid "ballots" that are sent alongside datum "votes" to a centralized smart contract "ballot box" in order to perform verifiable on-chain voting in NFT projects that do not have a governance token.
