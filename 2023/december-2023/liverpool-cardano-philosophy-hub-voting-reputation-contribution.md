# Liverpool Cardano Philosophy Hub: Voting, reputation, contribution

_**Liverpool Cardano Philosophy Hub**_ was a Fund 8 _Project Catalyst_ project exploring key blockchain concepts through the lens of philosophy. This session looked at blockchain communities' approach to governance and voting, including reputation and contribution systems, and asked what philosophy might be able to add to solving some of the problems of on-chain governance.

You can see the slides used in the session, and some links for further reading.
