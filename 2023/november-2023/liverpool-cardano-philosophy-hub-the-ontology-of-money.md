# Liverpool Cardano Philosophy Hub: The Ontology of Money

_**Liverpool Cardano Philosophy Hub**_ was a Fund 8 _Project Catalyst_ project exploring key blockchain concepts through the lens of philosophy. This session looked at the ontology of money - in other words, what money means - and examined whether cryptocurrency adheres to it, or subverts it.

You can see the slides used in the session, and some links for further reading.

**NOTE:** Subsequent sessions appear under _December 2023_.

### A fictional reading list

We experimentally asked ChatGPT to cite some relevant published articles on this topic - and, as is its wont, it hallucinated a set of articles that do not actually exist. We're listing them here because a) some of the _authors_ exist, and so do some of the publications, and they're interesting and worth a Google; and b) perhaps someone will be inspired to write one of the articles in this imaginary bibliography.
