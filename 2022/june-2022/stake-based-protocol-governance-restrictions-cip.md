# Stake-based Protocol Governance Restrictions (CIP)

## Abstract

The Cardano journey was divided into several phases, the last of which relates to the decentralization of the network governance. We call this last phase: 'Voltaire'. While Voltaire is in the making, some aspects of the protocol remain relatively centralized and under the control of a few entities. This proposal improves on the current status quo by adding a layer of control to the Stake Pool Operators (a.k.a. SPOs) and by extension, to delegators. This proposal is fairly lightweight and can be implemented without a hard fork.
