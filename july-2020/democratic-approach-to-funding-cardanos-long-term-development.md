# Democratic approach to funding Cardano’s long-term development

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/cXCmvQg_-J8" %}

Academic research fellow [Bingsheng Zhang](https://iohk.io/en/team/bingsheng-zhang) joined [#Cardano2020](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/cardano2020) to discuss how IOHK can effectively fund Cardano’s long term development. Cardano is attempting to move past the traditional blockchain finance models of ICOs, VC funding, and taxation. The voting and treasury system democratizes funding and puts the power of the purse in the hands of ada holders. With the Cardano treasury and voting system we can: - Provide funds for research and development. - Ensure that important monetary decisions are made by the people and for the people. - Give rewards for democratic participation
