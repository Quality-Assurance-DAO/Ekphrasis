## Anon Chat content

Community "skin in the game" is not represented in Wallet "Skin the game".

I feel like the next evolution of the communities in Cardano is to understand and share meaning around "trust registries"...the mechanisms which issue and legitimate DIDs (not validate, which is a technical term related to DID protocols)

Yes - DIDs could play a role in resolving these structural assymetries

I suspect DIDs will just 'show' that we have resolved asymmetry...underlying them must be symmetrical communities...maybe its a bit chicken/egg.

Interestingly, this doesn't even mention ADA being a governance token: https://cardano.org/what-is-ada/

If it emerges as a gov token, is this emergence a good thing? Bad because it wasn't part of the plan?

Should a smart contract be able to delegate to a dRep that is a smart contract? Is there any proof of humanity/personhood?&#x20;

From what I remember, there were some discussions around wallet activity monitoring and retiring DREP certificates but from I’m not sure about proof of livelihood.

Similar consideration as the question "Is a company a person ?" - or can sovereignty be collective ?

Do we really think that equal power given to all members of a community is a good thing? Does decentralization necessarily mean equality of power and voices?

Depend what power means in this context ?

Power is the ability to influence action

Alternative framing of the question: can a commons be sovereign (in some respect...maybe not all respects?)

Absolutely - but should everyone influence everything ? What about interests and capabilities ?

"influence"....🤔

I would think power would need a more direct mechanism than influence to cause action...force seems to be a requirement, and maybe what we mean by power is that the person with power also controls the accountability framework...so they have sequestered the feedback loop to themselves...

Just thinking out loud🤔
