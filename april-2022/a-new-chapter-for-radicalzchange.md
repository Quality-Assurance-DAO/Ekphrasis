# A new chapter for Radicalzchange

April 13th 2022

Hannah Arendt concludes her otherwise dark book, [Origins of Totalitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Origins\_of\_Totalitarianism), with the hopeful message that humanity’s greatest capacity is renewal–the capacity to begin again, to imagine and bring about new, better, common futures.

In other words, when we hear the end is near, let’s remember: renewal is here.

Many are starting to think about and plan for what comes [after (traditional) democracy](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300245967/after-democracy). It’s quite clear [technology will be at the center](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/political-ideologies-for-the-21st-century/), but it’s [not at all clear](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/autocracy-could-destroy-democracy-russia-ukraine/629363/) that it will be democratic renewal and digital democracy. That will take a concerted, generational effort; renewal [at every level](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691210568/renewal) of social organization.

It is in this spirit that we lay out our plans to renew our ideas, Foundation, and community.
