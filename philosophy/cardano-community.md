### Charles Hoskinson, Favorite Philosophers

#### Lex Fridman Podcast \#192

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKh8hjJNhWc&t=434s" %}



An extensive interview with Charles Hoskinson by Lex Fridman aired last week. The podcast covers many subjects and lasts over 4 hours. Different topics of conversation are timestamped on Lex Fridman's YouTube channel and well worth a listen. In this forum post I would like to summarise the topic ["Favorite Philosophers"](https://youtu.be/FKh8hjJNhWc?t=434), provide some commentary and references for further reading.

### Favorite Philosophers

Lex starts by quoting Charles as mentioning **Betrand Russell** \([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell), [Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy - SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/)\) and **Saul Kripke** \([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Kripke),[The Information Philosopher](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/kripke/)\) as "_two of your favourite philosophers_" and asks Charles to comment on what ideas of theirs he finds insightful.

Charles says that "you can't really talk about Russell and Saul without mentioning **Wittgenstein**" \([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein), [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/), [The Information Philosopher](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/wittgenstein/)\) “And **Tarski**” \([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Tarski), [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/tarski/)\). Together these philosophers increased the level of precision we have in formal languages and language in general.

### Wittgenstein

“_Wittgenstein makes no sense at all to me._” – Charles.

**My commentary** – Wittgenstein in effect founded **logical atomism** with his **Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus \(1921\)** – the intent of which is stated at the beginning as “_The world is the totality of facts, not of things._” Which is referred to as the “_Picture Theory of Language_”. Later Wittgenstein revised his views \(dubbing the Tractus “_dogmatic_”\) and went on to write his **Philosophical Investigations” \(1951\)** which introduced the concepts “_Meaning as use_”, “_Language-games_”, “_Family Resemblance_”, “_Rule-following_”, “_Private Language_” and “_Forms of Life_” into analytic philosophy.

“_Kripke has Kripkenstein_” – Charles.

**My commentary** – Charles is referring here to Saul Kripke’s **Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language \(1982\)**. \([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittgenstein_on_Rules_and_Private_Language)\) which, at its core, concerns the “_rule-following paradox_”. This paradox is a sceptical proposition concerning the possibility of following rules in language: “_.. no course of action could be determined by a rule, because any course of action can be made out to accord with the rule._” \(Philosophical Investigations §201a\).

### Modal logic

“_At least there I have modal logic …the little boxes and I have the diamonds. I can do a computation … and I can reason about what people are saying. Really it was all about precision and the nature of truth, precision and the nature of possibility ..._” – Charles

**My commentary** – Charles refers here to two of the fundamental symbols of modal logic \([https://iep.utm.edu/modal-lo/](https://iep.utm.edu/modal-lo/)\), _necessity_ “the little box” and _possibility_ “the diamonds”.

“_How far a formal language can take you ..._” – Charles

### David Hilbert

“_David Hilbert also did the same thing …_” – Charles

**My commentary** – Charles refers here to “Hilbert’s Program” \([https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hilbert-program/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hilbert-program/)\) that is, the formalization of all of mathematics in axiomatic form.

### Alfred North Whitehead

“_Russell got his career started with working with Alfred North Whitehead, a logician. There was this whole desire in late 19th century mathematics._"

### What is the difference between philosophy and computer science?
