# Accounting and auditing literature review

## Highlights

This review summarizes four themes emerging from the extant scholarly works focusing on the changes in recordkeeping in accounting with blockchain technology: event approach to accounting; real-time accounting; triple entry accounting and continuous auditing.&#x20;

Accounting professionals can enhance decision-making based on blockchain’s ability to provide immutable, append-only, shared, verified, and agreed-upon (i.e., consensus-driven) data, and AI’s ability to learn from data to recognize and apply patterns to augment decision-making.&#x20;

Continuous auditing will likely advance towards the integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain to form a coherent ecosystem for advanced continuous audits.

Smart contracts automate processes that can reduce managerial manipulation and opportunistic behaviour.&#x20;

Blockchain needs to be developed, standardized, and improved to overcome technical, organizational, and regulatory challenges to become truly an integral part of the financial system.
