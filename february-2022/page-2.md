## Blockchain Governance Principles

![](<../.gitbook/assets/2022-02-17 (1).png>)

Welcome everyone.

I would like to preface this presentation with the disclaimer that I am not an expert in Game Theory, Voting Systems or Social choice theory. My background is in Academic Philosophy and I approach these subjects as an amateur.

The purpose of this presentation is to draw attention to an interesting resource for understanding Blockchain governance in Cardano & Catalyst and to highlight possible further routes of enquiry.

The materials presented here will form part of the QADAO Ekphrasis philosophy GitBook which was successfully voted for in Fund 7 last week.

## “SoK: Blockchain Governance”

This presentation is an overview of Prof Aggelos Kiayias & Philip Lazo’s recent paper “SoK: Blockchain Governance” published on the 19th January 2022.

Here is a link to the paper - [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07188.pd](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07188.pdf)[f](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.07188.pdf)

Prof [Aggelos Kiayias](https://iohk.io/en/team/aggelos-kiayias) is Chief scientist at IOG Academic Research & the Chair in cybersecurity and privacy at the University of Edinburgh and [Philip Lazos](https://iohk.io/en/team/philip-lazos) is Research Fellow at IOG, Academic Research.

### The Social Choice Theory context

The paper “SoK: Blockchain Governance” published on 19th January 2022 provides a useful entry point into Blockchain Governance. The Authors focus is on voting systems. But the paper also hints at the broader context and references Social Choice Theory which addresses the more general governance challenge of aggregating individual preferences into societal preferences.

### Challenges of decentralised nature of blockchain governance

As the authors point out in their introduction, the decentralised nature of blockchain governance introduces new challenges where the diverse needs and preferences of participants will not always align. Therefore a degree of stability is sought to balance these diverse needs and to mitigate division.

### Off-chain & on-chain governance

In this context different governing mechanisms may take the form of 1) off-chain governance which is centralized in the trust invested in core developers or key contributors and 2) the voting mechanisms of on-chain governance which can be more transparent and inclusive.&#x20;

### Community division

But these mechanisms themselves are no guarantee against community division. If consensus fails then one part of the community can adopt a change they see as beneficial to themselves leaving another part of the community behind.

### Approach / Methodology

The approach the paper “SoK: Blockchain Governance” takes is to “derive a set of properties, that are drawn from general governance principles and election theory\
and then interpret them to the blockchain governance setting.”

### Sources

The sources the authors draw on include Council of Europe technical standards for e-voting, the Federal Election Commission’s Voting Systems Standards as well as blockchain specific standards.

### Evaluate a range of blockchain platforms

The authors go on to evaluate a range of blockchain platforms against those properties identifying their strengths and weaknesses. For the sake of brevity and focus I will not be covering the entirety of this section today. But rather on the Authors assessment of Project Catalyst.

### Related Work

A paper referred to in Related Work is also worth exploring –

Defining Blockchain Governance: A Framework for Analysis and Comparison ([https://slingerjansen.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/defining-blockchain-governance-a-framework-for-analysis-and-comparison.pdf](https://slingerjansen.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/defining-blockchain-governance-a-framework-for-analysis-and-comparison.pdf)) which takes an open source approach and defines blockchain governance as ”the means of achieving the direction, control, and coordination of stakeholders within the context of a given blockchain project to\
which they jointly contribute”.
