## Blockchain Governance Principles

![](<../.gitbook/assets/2022-02-17 (1).png>)

Welcome everyone.

I would like to preface this presentation with the disclaimer that I am not an expert in Game Theory, Voting Systems or Social choice theory. My background is in Academic Philosophy and I approach these subjects as an amateur.

The purpose of this presentation is to draw attention to an interesting resource for understanding Blockchain governance in Cardano & Catalyst and to highlight possible further routes of enquiry.

The materials presented here will form part of the QADAO Ekphrasis philosophy GitBook which was successfully voted for in Fund 7 last week.
