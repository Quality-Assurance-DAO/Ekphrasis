"The age of Voltaire will continue the transformation of the Cardano network to a self-sustaining system, defining the foundational standards for community-driven governance in blockchain technology. In this two-part segment, you’ll hear from IOG’s Constellation program director, Johnny Nguyen, and Product Manager Michael Madoff on the age of Voltaire and finally, the team concludes with a fireside chat including Charles to answer your governance questions.
