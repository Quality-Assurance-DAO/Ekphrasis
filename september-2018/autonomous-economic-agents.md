"_Autonomous Economic Agents are adaptive, independent programs that work for you, for an entity, or themselves for whatever reason theyâ€™re tasked. Fetch is a distributed network comprised of nodes which act as a service and directory for Autonomous Economic Agents (agents). Each install of Fetch (for example, you wish to run Fetch at home) is regarded as a node. This post is a rework of our introduction to agents from our_ [_technical introduction_](https://fetch.ai/technical-introduction)."
