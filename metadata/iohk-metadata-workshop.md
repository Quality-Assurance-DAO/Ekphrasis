Adding metadata – information about the data being processed – to transactions is key to new utility and use cases.

 In this workshop and Q&A session, you'll hear more about the practical implementation of transaction metadata on Cardano, presented by IOHK and the Cardano Foundation. 

Understand the technology, see the potential and learn more about real use cases. And build your own! How Transaction Metadata works on Cardano What metadata on Cardano is - and why it matters Overview of Node, Wallet, and Rosetta How to create, view, and manage transaction metadata Cost of metadata transactions and the documentation for this. How to Interact with Metadata Command Line Tool demo, Explorer Use of hashes and digital signatures \(generic cryptographic tools\) Potential Use Cases Example of metadata-based solutions Values of using metadata on Cardano \(some potential examples\) Open Q&A with the team.
