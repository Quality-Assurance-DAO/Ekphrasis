# What is a Governance Action ?



## “An On-Chain Decentralised Governance Mechanism for Voltaire”

Input-Output Global has drafted a Cardano Improvement Proposal, CIP 1694, that outlines “An On-Chain Decentralised Governance Mechanism for Voltaire”. This presentation by QADAO focuses on Governance Actions.

## What is a Governance Action ?

A governance action is a blockchain parameter (“on-chain event”) triggered by a time-limited transaction (“has a deadline after which it cannot be enacted”).

## Ratifying an action

A governance action is ratified once it has gathered enough votes to support it. If it fails to gather sufficient yes votes before its deadline the action expires. Or any action may be dropped subsequent to a motion of no confidence. Once ratified an action is said to be “enacted”.
