# Project Catalyst and Voltaire bring power to the people

#### Establishing a long-term future for Cardano growth has begun with a treasury and democratic voting in the Catalyst project

Designing a groundbreaking proof-of-stake blockchain means it is vital to ensure that the system is self-sustainable. This will allow it to drive growth and maturity in a truly decentralized and organic way. [Voltaire](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/voltaire/) is IOHKâ€™s way of establishing this capability, allowing the community to maintain the Cardano blockchain while continuing to develop it by proposing and implementing system improvements. This puts the power to make decisions in the hands of ada holders.
