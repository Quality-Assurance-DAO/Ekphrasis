Firms world-wide have furloughed workers whose skills diminish over time, and populations shrink. Firms need to adopt a digital-centric working world. How do business leaders position their firms for the digital Next Normal? How can technology help to advance social goals in a world fractured by the pandemic? And how to transition to trusting more fully in this new digital age?

Dr. Mihaela Ulieru, a digital ecosystems organization and transformation expert joined us at [#Cardano2020](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/cardano2020) to talk about organic governance and the Cardano ecosystem. The world has seen a tremendous failure of centralized power to act in the face of the recent pandemic. 'Bottom up' governance allows for challeges to be overcome through community involvement rather than bureaucratic control. Small projects have already leveraged this concept to great effect and blockchain technology stands to bring organic governance to the globe.
