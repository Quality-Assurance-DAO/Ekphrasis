The proof of stake blockchain Cardano is progressing towards the Voltaire era of its Roadmap ([https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/voltaire/](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/voltaire/). ). As part of an exercise to establish a constitution the desire to identify community values has been expressed.&#x20;

## The Ethics of Blockchain

QA-DAO believes that an essential foundation of value discovery is an appreciation and understanding of the ethical dimension of the use of blockchain in organizations and communities.&#x20;

Academic work on the ethics of blockchain in organizations is already proceeding. One good overview of the subject can be found in the 2022 paper “The Ethics of Blockchain in Organizations” ([https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-022-05058-5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-022-05058-5)). The 2022 paper examines “Decentralised People Operations” (DPO) and is relevant in this context of Blockchain’s “impact on human interactions and human decision-making in organizations.”
