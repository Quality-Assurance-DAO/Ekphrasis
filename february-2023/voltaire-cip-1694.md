# Voltaire CIP-1694

Cardano is a blockchain platform and cryptocurrency that was developed to provide a more secure and sustainable infrastructure for decentralized applications and digital assets. It is based on the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and utilizes smart contracts, which allow developers to build decentralized applications on the platform.

The Voltaire era of Cardano aims to make the network self-sustaining by adding a voting and treasury system. This will allow network participants to use their stake and voting rights to shape the future development of the network.
